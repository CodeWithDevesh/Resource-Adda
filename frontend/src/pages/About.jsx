                        As part of the project, I worked on developing a website
                        where I contributed to making it responsive across
                        different devices. I was involved in both designing and
                        creating webpages, ensuring the website was not only
                        visually appealing but also fully functional. This
                        project allowed me to enhance my skills in web design,
                        responsiveness, and functionality.
